# Pass/Fail Prediction

## Description

This project implements a Pass/Fail prediction system using a Perceptron model. It predicts whether a student will pass or fail based on their marks in different subjects. The model is trained using a dataset and a learning algorithm that adjusts the model's weights based on the data.

The application consists of the following components:
1. **Row Class**: Stores the student data (marks) and pass/fail status.
2. **Perceptron Class**: The neural network model used for predictions.
3. **Main Interface**: A GUI application where users can input marks and train the model.

## Features

- Input student marks.
- Train the model with the specified learning rate and number of epochs.
- Predict pass/fail status based on the trained model.
- The system includes GUI components for user interaction.
